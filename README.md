A vanilla HTML and CSS practice page. Crude. Vanilla

Please feel free to take my code and learn from it. 
I basically went down the page making section by section. Many of the methods are crude and sometimes use simple percentage units to shift over elements; but this is a beginner page, and on a serious note as a beginner this page should be a good practice to see if you know what all the different methods used are for / how they work.
